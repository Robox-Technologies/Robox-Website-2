                    <strong>STEM education should be for everyone.</strong><br>
                    At Ro/Box, our mission is to make hands-on engineering and coding education more affordable and accessible to all students,
                    regardless of their background or resources.
                    We are greatly motivated by the opportunities of STEM and robotics,
                    and believe the future belongs to creators, problem-solvers, and innovators.
                    By breaking down the financial barriers to robotics, we hope to open the door for everyone to experience the opportunities
                    and love for robotics we have.

                    Ro/Box was founded by <a href="https://madebyyuma.com" target="_blank">Yuma Soerianto</a> as his project for the <a href="https://www.risefortheworld.org/winners/hadriel-yuma-soerianto" target="_blank">Rise Challenge</a>,
                    which selects 100 young people globally to support their global impact initiatives.
                    Yuma's project focused on tackling the high cost of robotics in STEM education,
                    motivated by the high prices of robotics kits at his school's robotics club.
                    These high prices pose serious challenges for schools and limit access to STEM learning for countless students.

                    Ro/Box went on to become a winning project for the Rise Challenge.<br>
                    With this newfound opportunity, our team was formed: Yuma, <a href="https://ashtondoughty.com" target="_blank">Ashton</a>, and Seb.
                    Together, we turned Ro/Box from prototype to reality:
                    an ultra-affordable robotics kit designed to make STEM education accessible to any student, anywhere.
                    To complement it, we developed a website filled with guides,
                    learning resources, and a block coding editor, all for free—making
                    it easy and inviting for anyone to start exploring engineering and programming with Ro/Box.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe that by lowering the cost of robotics—and
                    reducing the barrier to entry into STEM—we
                    can directly support schools and increase student engagement.
                    Over time, we hope this will give more and more students the opportunity to fall in love with robotics the same way we did.
